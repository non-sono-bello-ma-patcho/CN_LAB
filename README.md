# Looks like a repository!
Hi! this repository is a collection of Numerical Calculation's project class we're currently attending!

## Project list:
  ### error and precision:
  this project is about error and machine's computation precision:
  - [error1](error/error1.cpp): compute in double precision simple sums;
  - [error2](error/error2.cpp): compute Taylor's expansion for f(x)=e^x and check absolute and relative error;
  - [error3](error/error3.cpp): determine machine precision *eps=2^-d* (where *d* is the greatest integer such that *1+2^(-d)>1*) for double and single precision;
